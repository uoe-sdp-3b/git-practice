This is the master repository.

no code should be written on the master repository,
rather, everything should be written on its own branch, (try `git branch` for a list of branches on the local machine, run `man git-branch` for more information about branching.)

you can checkout other repositories by using the 'checkout' command.
look into how you can create your own branches (HINT: maybe there is a way to do it using the `checkout` command)

Try moving to the branch called 'hamish'
